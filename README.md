# Andriod-GPS-Location-Bluetooth-Broadcast
An Android Application Built to send GPS location data to a bluetooth receiver. This data was used as ground truth for statistical analysis for a dead reckoning system.

This was developed and tested using a Google Pixel 6a.The app requires the phoneâ€™s bluetooth feature and acts as a bluetooth client. In addition to the app, our team created a Bluetooth Server using Python to obtain from the phone bluetooth client. Now, this app allows us to obtain real-time GPS data as well as allows users to select the frequency of the GPS that will be collected.
